# Better Open Editors

### Todo

- Setting: File in folder triggers package folder (package.json, composer.json, ...)  
- Groups are ignored at the moment  
- Upstream issue: The order is not taken into account when calling the extension settings directly via @ext:McSodbrenner.better-open-editors  
- Upstream issue: tab.input.constructor.name is just "ui" instead of TabInputCustom
